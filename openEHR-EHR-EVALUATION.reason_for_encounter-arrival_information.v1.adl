Reason for Encounter is a common phrase used in clinical medicine, however the term is often used in two common ways - one that refers to an administrative category for provision of healthcare and the other that reflects the clinical drive to seek healthcare.
Motivos para o encontro é um termo comum, usado na clinica médica, contudo o termo pode expressar doi caminhos: um que se refere a categoria administrativa para provisão do atendimento e outro que reflete a direção clinica para busca do cuidado ao paciente.

In an effort to clarify the phrases and intent, this archetype contains two data elements:
- The first, 'Reason for Contact', to document the administrative type of healthcare sought or required - for example the type of consultation, emergency care, pre-operative assessment, routine antenatal visit or elective admission. This data element reflects the administrative category of care provision. Use of the phrase 'Reason for Contact', rather than 'Reason for Encounter' or 'Reason for Visit' reflects the increasing trend towards alternative methods of healthcare provision that may not result in face-to-face contact between the healthcare provider and patient within a consulting room.
- The second, 'Presenting Problem', to document the clinical reasons for healthcare contact. These are intended mainly to capture the patient's perceived issues or symptoms which have triggered them to seek healthcare advice, such as desire to quit smoking, stress, shortness of breath or abdominal pain. Signs such as impaired conscious state may also be captured here, for example by paramedical staff with an unconscious patient.

Em um esforço para esclarecer as frases e intenção, este arquétipo contém dois elementos de dados:
- O primeiro \"Motivo do contato ', para documentar o tipo administrativo de saúde procurado ou necessário - por exemplo, o tipo de consulta, atendimento de emergência, a avaliação pré-operatória, consulta pré-natal de rotina ou admissão eletiva. Este elemento de dados reflete a categoria administrativa da prestação de cuidados. O uso da expressão \"razão para o contato ', ao invés de' Razão para Encontro 'ou' motivo da visita\" reflecte a tendência crescente de métodos alternativos de prestação de cuidados de saúde que podem não resultar em contato face-a-face entre o profissional de saúde e paciente dentro de um consultório.
- O segundo, \"Apresentando Problema ', para documentar as razões clínicas para contato saúde. Estes destinam-se principalmente para capturar problemas ou sintomas que desencadearam os a procurar aconselhamento de saúde, como o desejo de parar de fumar, stress, falta de ar ou dor abdominal percebidas do paciente. Sinais como estado de consciência prejudicada também podem ser capturados aqui, por exemplo, o pessoal paramédico com um paciente inconsciente.

Chief Complaint is another phrase in common usage. In effect it is probably a type of Presenting Problem but has not currently been modelled explicitly. As Presenting Problem has occurrences set to unbounded, multiple Presenting Problems can be recorded.  Feedback will be sought regarding the need for this to be modelled in it's own right.(en)

Queixa principal é outra frase de uso comum. Com efeito, é provavelmente um tipo de problema, mas Apresentando momento não foi modelado de forma explícita. Como Apresentar Problema tem ocorrências definidas como ilimitado, vários problemas de apresentação pode ser gravada. O gabarito será procurado sobre a necessidade de que isso seja modelado em seu próprio direito. ">
